===========================

Your task is defined as follows:

	- Implement the get_highest_path_weight function in tree.c.
	- Implement the count_siblings function in tree.c.
	- Write unit tests for both functions.


get_highest_path_weight
=======================
Suppose we have the following tree:

		1
	       / \
	      2   3
             / \   \
            5   4   6

A path shall be defined as any ordered set of tree nodes {x1, x2, ..., xN} where
x1 is the root of the tree, xN is any node in the tree, and for any i between 1
and N, x(i + 1) is a child of x(i). Thus, in the example above, the paths are:

	{1, 2, 5}
	{1, 2, 4}
	{1, 2}
	{1, 3, 6}
	{1, 3}
	{1}

The weight of a given path of a tree shall be defined as the sum of the values
of all nodes in the path. NOTE THAT THE VALUE OF A TREE NODE MAY BE NEGATIVE.
Your get_highest_path_weight function should compute the highest path weight
for a given tree. In this example, that number would be 10 corresponding to the
path {1, 3, 6}.


count_siblings
==============
Two nodes form a sibling pair if they have the same parent node. Your
count_sibling function should simply count the number of such pairs in a
given tree. In the example above, we would count 2 pairs: (2, 3) and (5, 4).


Testing
=======
You will need to be able to create various trees to write good unit tests.
You can always create the trees manually, but that's tedious. Best is if you
build the trees using your build tree function from PA08 in combination with
input files. Feel free to add helper functions to tree.c and tree.h.


Submission
==========
To submit you work, do just like you did for exam 2, navigate back to the parent
of your final exam directory, and compress the final exam directory with:

	zip -r <final exam directory>.zip <final exam directory>

where <final exam directory> is the name of that directory. Submit the zipped
folder through the final exam quiz on Brightspace.
